## Where to get the app


To set-up Sense, you will first need to download the Sense app which you can find at:

- [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.hello.sense&hl=en)

- [App Store](https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?mt=8&path=apps%2fsense)


The app will guide you through the set-up process. The app is where all your sleep data is stored. You’ll be able to see your timeline, trends and sleep insights. You’ll also be able to set your Smart Alarm.
