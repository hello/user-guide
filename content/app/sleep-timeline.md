## Reading your Sleep Timeline


Sense interprets the data from your sleep and your bedroom and gives you a detailed timeline of the events that occurred during that period. Youâ€™ll be able to see everything, from tossing and turning, to lights being switched on during the night. Sense uses a learning algorithm so that, with every sleep cycle that passes, it will gain a more comprehensive understanding of how you sleep.
