## Reading your Sleep Timeline


Sense interprets the data from your sleep and your bedroom and gives you a detailed timeline of the events that occurred during that period. Youâ€™ll be able to see everything, from tossing and turning, to lights being switched on during the night. Sense uses a learning algorithm so that, with every sleep cycle that passes, it will gain a more comprehensive understanding of how you sleep.


Tapping an icon in your timeline, will allow you to see more information. 


You can find out if you were in light, medium or deep sleep by pressing and holding the bars in your timeline.
