## Sleep Trends


After a week with Sense, youâ€™ll be able to see historical data on your sleep patterns. Your trends will allow you to track the evolution of your sleep and see how it changes over time. This will give you a macro picture of your general level of sleep health, helping you to adjust your patterns accordingly over time.
