## WiFi


Sense uses WiFi to communicate with your servers. Make sure you know your Network and Password.


You will need to have a 2.4GHz network for Sense to connect. At this time we do not support 5GHz.



#Change your WiFi network.
Open Sense App> Tap Settings icon> ‘Sense and Sleep Pill> ‘Sense’> Edit WiFi> Select your Wifi network > Enter WiFi network password
