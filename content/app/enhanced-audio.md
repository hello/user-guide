## Enhanced Audio


Sense will detect background noises such as a car alarm going off or a siren outside. Enhanced Audio will track snoring, sleep talking and noise disturbances within close range and report them within your timeline to give you a complete view of your night. You can choose to activate Enhanced Audio on setup and within settings in the app.


**Turn on enhanced audio:**


Open Sense App> Tap Settings icon> My Account> Enhanced Audio> Switch on
