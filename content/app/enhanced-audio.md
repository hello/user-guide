## Enhanced Audio


This will allow Sense to pick up snoring, sleep talking and other noise disturbances.


Without enhanced audio enabled, Sense only looks at background noise such as car alarms and sirens.


**Turn on enhanced audio.**


Open Sense App> Tap Settings icon> My Account> Enhanced Audio> Switch on
