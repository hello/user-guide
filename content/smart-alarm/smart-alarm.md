## What is the Smart Alarm


Senseâ€™s Smart Alarm will wake you up at the lightest part of your natural sleep cycle, up to 30 minutes before your requested wake-up time, making sure you wake up refreshed and at the right time for you. We have composed custom Wake Tones that play using the built-in speaker to provide the best sound possible to gently and gradually awaken you.
