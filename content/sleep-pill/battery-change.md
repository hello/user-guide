## Battery Change

**Battery Needed:**


- Battery Coin cell CR2025


**Instructions for replacing your Sleep Pill battery:**


1. With the Hello logo faced up (facing you), pry up from the top edge and pop the cap off.

2. Remove the battery. Verify you have the right type of battery by looking at the number on it.

3. Replace with new battery. Take your new battery and pop it back in. The positive (+) sign should be right side up (facing out towards you).

4. Place the white plate on top of your Sleep Pill making sure the groves match.  Slide one of the tabs into the open groove. When that is aligned, visually align the other two tabs and snap down.

5. Once the battery is in, shake it a few times near the Sense and it should be active. You will not have to re-sync.
