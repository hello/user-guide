## Multiple Alarms


You can set as many alarms as you like, with two restrictions:

-currently only one Smart Alarm, per person, per day

-if you use Sense with a partner, you canâ€™t both have an Alarm set for the exact same time (either Smart or Regular)


You may encounter the following error if the above restrictions are violated
