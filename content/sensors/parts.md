## Particulate


Particulate Sensor can spot the tiniest of things floating around in the air, so tiny you can't even see most of them. But they are there, and they are potential sleep interrupters for many; more than 50 million people suffer from nasal allergies. If the pollen count is high in your neighborhood and Sense detects a rising level of microscopic particles in your bedroom, you should know.
