## Gestures


The only gesture you need to use with Sense is waving your hand over it.


When you wave your hand over Sense, move it at a steady pace and make sure to keep it close to Sense.


Once you wave your hand over Sense, it’ll tell you the status of your bedroom through glowing different colors. 

- Green means everything is good.

- Yellow mean something’s a little off.

- Orange means you should adjust something.


You can also wave your hand over Sense to turn off your Smart Alarm.
