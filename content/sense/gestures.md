## Gestures


The only gesture you need to use with Sense is waving your hand over it.


When you do wave your hand over Sense, make sure you keep your hand close to Sense and move your hand at a steady pace. 


Once you wave your hand over Sense, it’ll tell you the status of your bedroom through glowing different colors. 
Green means everything is good.
Yellow mean something’s a little off.
Orange means you should adjust something.


You can also wave your hand over Sense to turn off the alarm.
