## Your Sleep Score


Every morning you will receive a unique Sleep Score out of 100. This is calculated based on all the sensor data from your bedroom, as well as how you actually slept. Your Sleep Score allows you to see the quality of your previous night’s sleep at a glance. You’ll also be able to view your Sleep Score on a weekly basis, allowing you to easily track your progress over time.
