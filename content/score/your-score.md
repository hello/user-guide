## Your Sleep Score


Each night Sense calculates your Sleep Score. This score takes into account all of the sensor data and variables that Sense monitors to generate a score out of 100 for your previous night.


It looks at both the environment of your bedroom, such as disturbances during the night or whether your room was too bright for an ideal nightâ€™s rest, as well as how you actually slept yourself.
