## Sense Cannot Connect to the Internet


Your Sense is unable to connect to the internet. To fix this problem:


- Make sure that your Sense is within range of your WiFi network

- Make sure that your WiFi network has an internet connection

- Make sure that Sense can still connect to your WiFi network by launching the Sense app, and navigating to Settings > Sense and Sleep Pill > Sense and tapping ‘Edit WiFi.’ You will be prompted to re-connect to your WiFi network.

If Sense is still unable to connect to the internet, try unplugging Sense, waiting 5 seconds, and then replugging Sense into power. Then try again. You can also try conntecting and disconnecting your wireless router. If you need additional help, please [contact support.](https://support.hello.is/hc/en-us/requests/new)
