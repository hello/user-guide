## Pairing your Sleep Pill


Sleep Pill clips to your pillow and tracks your sleep at night. The Sense app will walk you through pairing your Sleep Pill to your account. When prompted, shake your Sleep Pill for three seconds. 


If you’re having trouble pairing your Sleep Pill:

- Try shaking your Sleep Pill a bit harder, and ensure you’re shaking it for three full seconds

- Make sure your Sleep Pill is within range of Sense (about 15 feet)

- Make sure your wireless network has an internet connection, and that Sense is within range

- Make sure your mobile device has an internet connection, and is within Bluetooth range of Sense (about 25 feet)

- Sleep Pills can only be paired to one account at a time -- make sure your Sleep Pill has not been paired to any other accounts


If you’re still unable to pair your Sleep Pill, try unplugging Sense, waiting 5 seconds, and then replugging Sense into power. Then try again. If you need additional help, please [contact support.](https://support.hello.is/hc/en-us/requests/new)
