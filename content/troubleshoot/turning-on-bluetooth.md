## Turning on Bluetooth

iOS: 

Sense communicates with your mobile device using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Turn your Bluetooth on by navigating to Settings > Bluetooth and flipping the switch to ‘On.’ Then, return to the Sense app to continue. You can also turn on Bluetooth using Control Center.


*Note: Bluetooth pairing is set up from within the Sense app -- not your device’s Bluetooth settings. Do not attempt to connect with Sense from inside of your device’s Settings.*


Android:

Sense communicates with your mobile device using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The Sense app will detect if your Bluetooth is off, and prompt you to turn it on. To manually turn on/off Bluetooth on most Android phones running Jelly Bean or KitKat, pull down the notification drawer, press the gear button, and long press the Bluetooth button. You may also toggle Bluetooth power from settings, though its location depends in manufacturer. On devices running Lollipop, pull down the notification drawer and tap the area with the date. After it expands, you can tap the Bluetooth logo to toggle it on and off.
