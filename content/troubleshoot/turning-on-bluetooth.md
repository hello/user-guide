## Turning on Bluetooth

iOS: 

Sense communicates with your mobile device using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Turn your Bluetooth on by navigating to Settings > Bluetooth and flipping the switch to ‘On.’ Then, return to the Sense app to continue. You can also turn on Bluetooth using Control Center.



Note: Bluetooth pairing is set up from within the Sense app -- not your device’s Bluetooth settings. Do not attempt to connect with Sense from inside of Settings.


Android:

Sense communicates with your mobile device using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The Sense app will detect if your Bluetooth is off, and prompt you to turn it on.
