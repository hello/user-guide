## Android Bluetooth Problems

Bluetooth on Android is unstable on many devices. The Sense app is able to compensate for most problems, but some errors cannot be recovered from without your intervention.


**Recovering from most Fatal Errors**

Some errors do not reoccur if you retry your operation. If retrying the operation does not succeed, turning on “Airplane Mode” usually resolves most issues.


1. Open the notification drawer, or the Settings app

2. Find the “Airplane Mode” option

3. Turn on “Airplane mode”

4. Wait for 2 to 3 seconds

5. Turn off “Airplane Mode”

6. Retry the operation in the Sense app


If the above steps fail, we recommend that you restart your Android device. If the problem persists after restarting your Android device, please send us an email at [support@hello.is](support@hello.is).


**Make sure your device is up to date**

With each new version of Android made available to consumers, the general stability of Bluetooth has increased. If you’re experiencing persistent errors when attempting to set up Sense, we recommend that you make sure your device is running the latest version of Android possible. Most devices will alert you to Android updates with a persistent notification. To manually check for an update:


**On newer Samsung devices:**

1. Open the Settings app

2. Go to the “General” tab

3. Click on “About device” at the bottom of the list

4. Click on “Software update”

5. Click on “Update now”

6. If an update is available, follow the directions on the screen


**On most other devices:**

1. Open the Settings app

2. Scroll to the bottom of the list

3. Click on “About phone”

4. Click on “Software updates”

5. Click on “Check for update”

6. If an update is available, follow the directions on the screen.
