## Sleep Pill Not Seen In Days

We haven't seen data from your Sleep Pill lately. 

Please make sure: 


1. Your Sleep Pill is within range of your Sense (x feet). 
2. Make sure your Sleep Pill has not run out of battery: shake your pill for three seconds, and your Sense should light up. If your Sense does not light up, you may need to replace your battery (link)
