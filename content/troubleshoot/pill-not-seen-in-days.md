## Sleep Pill Not Seen Recently


Your Sleep Pill seems to have stopped sending data to our servers. You can see the last time Sleep Pill was able to upload data by launching the Sense application, and navigating to Settings > Sense and Sleep Pill. Sleep Pill should normally not go more than a day without uploading data. In order to make sure that Sleep Pill is able to continue uploading your data, make sure Sleep Pill is within range of your Sense (about 15 feet), and that Sense is connected to the internet.


Also, make sure Sleep Pill has a functioning battery -- if you shake your Sleep Pill for three seconds, your Sense should briefly light up. If Sense does not light up, you may need to [replace your battery](http://guide.hello.is/sleep-pill/battery-change/)
