## Connecting Sense to WiFi


Sense connects to the internet over WiFi. To connect Sense to WiFi, select your network from the list. If you don’t see your network listed, tap ‘Rescan.’ 

*Note: If your wireless network is “hidden,” tap ‘Other’ at the bottom of the network list. You’ll be prompted to manually enter your SSID and password. If your WiFi network has no password, you can leave the password field blank and set the security type to ‘Open.’*


If you’re having trouble connecting Sense to WiFi:

- Make sure Sense is within range of your wireless network

- Make sure your wireless network has an internet connection

- Make sure your mobile device is within Bluetooth range of Sense (about 25 feet)
