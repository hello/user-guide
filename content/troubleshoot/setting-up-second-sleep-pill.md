## Setting up a Second Sleep Pill


Sense can be used with either one or two people. Each person who uses Sense will use the Sense app on their own mobile device to create their own account and set up their own Sleep Pill. Visit [http://senseapp.com](http://senseapp.com) to download the application to get started.


If your partner is nearby and available at the time when you first set up Sense, and would like to set up their Sleep Pill at that time, you can select 'Add another Sleep Pill now' to put Sense into Pairing mode for him or her. If they're not nearby or available at that time, don't worry, they can always set up their Sleep Pill at a later time. If you put Sense into [Pairing Mode](http://guide.hello.is/troubleshoot/pairing-mode/), but then change your mind, you can dismiss Pairing Mode by holding your hand directly on top of Sense for two seconds, and then removing it.


If your partner wishes to set up their Sleep Pill at a later time, they can do so by downloading the Sense app at [http://senseapp.com](http://senseapp.com) and following the instructions. In order to pair their mobile device, Sense will need to be put into [Pairing Mode.](http://guide.hello.is/troubleshoot/pairing-mode/)
