## Setting up a Second Sleep Pill

Sense can be used with one or two people. Each person who uses Sense will use the app to create their own account and set up their own Sleep Pill. If your partner is nearby and available at the time when you set up, you can select 'Add another Sleep Pill' to put Sense into Pairing mode for him/her. If they're not around/available, don't worry, they can always set up their Sleep Pill at a later time.
