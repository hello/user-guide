## Sense Not Seen In Days

Sense seems to have stopped communicating with our servers. 


Please make sure: 


1. Your Sense is plugged in
2. Your Sense is within WiFi range
3. That your network has an internet connection. 

Try the following: 


Using the Sense app, go to Settings -> Devices and confirm that your Sense is connected to your WiFi network. If you don't see your WiFi network listed, tap into the Sense menu and select 'Edit WiFi' to attempt to reconnect to WiFi. (screenshots)
