## Sense Not Seen Recently


Your Sense seems to have stopped communicating with our servers. You can see the last time Sense was able to upload data by launching the Sense application, and navigating to Settings > Sense and Sleep Pill. In order to make sure that Sense is able to continue uploading your data:

- Make sure that your Sense is plugged in and connected to power

- Make sure that your Sense is within range of your WiFi network

- Make sure that your WiFi network has an internet connection

- Make sure that your Sense is connected to the correct WiFi network by launching the Sense app, and navigating to Settings > Sense and Sleep Pill. You will see the currently connected WiFi network listed under the Sense menu. Inside the Sense menu, tap ‘Edit WiFi’ to change the currently connected WiFi network.

If Sense is still unable to upload data,  try unplugging Sense, waiting 5 seconds, and then replugging Sense into power. Then try again. You can also try conntecting and disconnecting your wireless router. If you need additional help, [contact support.](https://support.hello.is/hc/en-us/requests/new)
