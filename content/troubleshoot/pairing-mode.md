## Putting Sense into Pairing Mode


Sense glows purple to indicate that it is in Pairing Mode and ready to be paired with your mobile device over Bluetooth. When you plug Sense in for the first time, it will be put into Pairing Mode for you automatically. To pair another mobile device with Sense, you will need to put Sense into Pairing Mode. There are two ways to put Sense into Pairing Mode:


- Place your hand directly on top of Sense for seven seconds, and then remove it. Sense will glow purple to indicate that it is in Pairing Mode. The lights may briefly flash when you first place your hand on top of Sense, but keep your hand in place for the full seven seconds before removing.

- If your partner’s mobile device is already connected to Sense, they can put Sense into Pairing Mode using the Sense app. Have them launch the Sense app, then navigate to Settings > Sense and Sleep Pill > Sense, and then tap ‘Put Sense into Pairing Mode.’ Sense will glow purple to indicate that it is in Pairing Mode.


Pairing Mode will automatically turn off when a device is successfully connected over Bluetooth. To turn Pairing Mode off manually, just place your hand directly on top of Sense for two seconds, and then remove it.
