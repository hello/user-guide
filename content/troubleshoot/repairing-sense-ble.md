## Re-pairing Your Mobile Device with Sense over BLE


It's possible that the Bluetooth connection between Sense and your mobile device has been lost. You'll need to re-pair with your Sense over BLE to perform certain operations. To do so: 

- Put Sense into Pairing Mode by placing your hand directly on top of Sense for seven seconds, and then removing it. Sense will glow purple when it is in Pairing Mode.

- iOS only: Navigate to Settings > Bluetooth, select Sense from the list, and then tap ‘Forget this Device.’

- Launch the Sense app, and navigate to Settings > Sense and Sleep Pill. After a few seconds, you should see a prompt to pair with Sense over BLE. Tap ‘Pair’ to re-establish a Bluetooth connection with Sense.
