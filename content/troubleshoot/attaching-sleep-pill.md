## Attaching Sleep Pill to your Pillow


Sleep Pill clips to your pillow and tracks your sleep at night. Clip Sleep Pill to the edge of your pillowcase that’s closest to the side of the bed you sleep on. It may take a bit of elbow grease to get your Sleep Pill attached -- it’s a snug fit so that it doesn’t fall off while you move around during the night.
