## Pairing With Sense Over BLE

Make sure sense is glowing purple: if not, hold your hand directly on top of Sense for 7 seconds, then remove. Sense should glow purple to indicate it's in Pairing Mode. 


If pairing fails, make sure: you're within Bluetooth range (x feet), your device's Bluetooth is on, sense is plugged in and in Pairing Mode (glowing purple), no one else is connected to Sense over Bluetooth. If pairing continues to fail: ______ (power cycle? check/forget devices in BLE settings? kill app? -- need to check with HW/SW).
