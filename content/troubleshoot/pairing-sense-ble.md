## Pairing With Sense Over BLE

First, make sure Sense is glowing purple to indicate that it is in Pairing Mode, and ready to pair with your mobile device. 

*If Sense is not glowing purple, see Putting [Sense into Pairing Mode.](http://guide.hello.is/troubleshoot/pairing-mode/)*

Tap Continue, and the app will scan for your Sense, and then prompt you to pair. Press ‘Pair’ on the dialog to pair with your Sense. 

If you’re having trouble pairing with Sense over BLE:

- Make sure Sense is plugged into power and in [Pairing Mode](http://guide.hello.is/troubleshoot/pairing-mode/)

- Make sure you’re within Bluetooth range of Sense (about 25 feet)

- Make sure no other devices are actively connected with Sense over Bluetooth. If your partner is setting up Sense for the first time, wait for them to finish before starting your setup.

- iOS: If your mobile device has been previously paired with Sense, or if you’ve been able to partially pair with Sense but have been unable to finish the pairing process, you may need to ‘Forget’ Sense in your device’s Bluetooth settings before proceeding. 

**To forget Sense:**

Navigate to Settings > Bluetooth, select Sense from the list, and then tap ‘Forget this Device.’ Then return to the Sense app and try again.


If you’re still unable to pair over Bluetooth, try power cycling Sense by unplugging, waiting 5 seconds, and then replugging Sense into power. Then try again. If you need additional help, contact [support.](https://support.hello.is/hc/en-us/requests/new)
