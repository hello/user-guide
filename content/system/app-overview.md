## Sense App Overview

The Sense iOS and Android applications tell you everything you need to know about your night.



Sense interprets the data from your sleep and your bedroom and gives you a detailed timeline of the events that occurred during that time. Youâ€™ll be able to see everything, from tossing and turning, to car alarms going off. If you enable enhanced audio, Sense will detect noise disturbances such as snoring and sleep talking, tell you at what time it happened and playback an audio clip.



You will also see your unique Sleep Score, insights to help you sleep better and be able to set your smart alarm.
