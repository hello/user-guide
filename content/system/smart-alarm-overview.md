## Smart Alarm Overview

Waking up every morning should feel great every morning. With Sense's Smart Alarm, you are awakened by one of ten sounds composed just for Sense to help you wake up. Each one of these awakening sounds is designed to wake you up in the most natural way possible, not like the alarm clock you're used to. Sense will wake you when you are in the lightest part of your sleep cycle within 30 minutes prior to the time you set. That way, you wake up at the right time for you.
