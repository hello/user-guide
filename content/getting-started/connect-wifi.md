## Connect to WiFi

Sense uses WiFi to communicate with our servers. Make sure you know your Network and Password.

You will need to have a 2.4GHz network for Sense to connect. At this time we do not support 5GHz.


Select your Wifi network from the list. If you don’t see your network, try moving closer to your wireless router and rescanning. If you have a hidden Network, tap ‘Other’ and fill in your network and password. Having trouble?


Enter your WiFi password and tap ‘Continue.’ Your Sense will connect to your WiFi network.
