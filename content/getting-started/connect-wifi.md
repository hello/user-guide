## Connect to WiFi

Sense uses WiFi to communicate with your servers. Make sure you know your Network and Password.


You will need to have a 2.4GHz network for Sense to connect. At this time we do not support 5GHz.


[Screenshot: Select your Network]
Select your Wifi network from the list. If you don’t see your network, try moving closer to your wireless router and rescanning. If you have a hidden Network, tap ‘Other’ and fill in your network and password. Having trouble?


[Screenshot: Enter Password]
Enter your WiFi password and tap ‘Continue.’ Your Sense will attempt to connect to your WiFi network.
