## Pairing your Sleep Pill


Sleep Pill clips to your pillow and tracks your sleep during the night. Each person using Sense has their own Sleep Pill, so if you're using Sense with a partner, they will set up their Pill separately. 


When prompted, shake your Sleep Pill for three seconds to pair it with your Sense. You may need to shake it quickly for it to register.
