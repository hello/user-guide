1. Place your Sense on a nightstand next to your bed.


2. Attach the cable to the USB port on the adaptor and plug it in. The micro USB end inserts at the base of Sense.


3. Sense will glow purple indicating that it’s ready to be paired. 


4. You’ll first need to download the Sense app from our website at senseapp.com. 


5. The app will prompt you to set up an account and give us a few details about yourself. These details will help ensure the accuracy of your sleep insights.
Now, you can pair your phone with Sense. Make sure you have your phone’s Bluetooth turned on.


6. Next, choose your WiFi network and enter your password. 


7. Now, you’ll need to pair your Sleep Pill to Sense. 


8. Your Sleep Pill stays on your pillow so it can track your sleep. 


9. Then you’ll shake your Sleep Pill for three seconds. Sense will glow white when your Sleep Pill is connected.


10.To attach your Sleep Pill hold the edge of your pillowcase taut, like this, and slide on your Sleep Pill. It’s a snug fit to make sure it doesn’t fall off.


11.Last but not least, you can set your first Smart Alarm. 


Now you’re all set up, and ready for a good night’s sleep.
