## Clipping your Sleep Pill


**Attach Sleep Pill to your Pillow.**

Sleep Pill clips to your pillow and tracks your sleep during the night. 
 

Attach your Sleep Pill to the pillowcase you sleep on.


Hold the edge of your pillowcase taut and slide on your Sleep Pill. It’s a snug fit to make sure it doesn’t fall off.
