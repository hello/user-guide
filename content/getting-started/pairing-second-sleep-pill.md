## Pair a second Sleep Pill


Each person who uses Sense will have their own Sleep Pill, and create their own account to use with Sense. If your partner is available when you initially set up your Sense, you can select ‘Set up another Sleep Pill’ to put Sense back into [Pairing Mode](http://guide.hello.is/troubleshoot/pairing-mode/) so that they can get set up. If your partner is not available at that time, or you purchase a second Sleep Pill at a later date, they can always get set up later.


To pair a second Sleep Pill to your Sense, have your partner visit [senseapp.com](http://hello.is) to download the Sense application and set up their account. They will be given instructions to pair their Sleep Pill.
