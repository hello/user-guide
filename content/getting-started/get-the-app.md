## Where to get the app

To set-up Sense, you will first need to download the Sense app which you can find at:

- [Senseapp.com](hello.is)

- [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store)

- [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8)



The app will guide you through the set-up process. The app is where all your sleep data is stored. You’ll be able to see your timeline, trends and sleep insights. You’ll also be able to set your Smart Alarm.
