## Sense Overview

The first system for understanding your sleep and bedroom.


Sense is a simple system that tracks your sleep, monitors the environment in your bedroom and reinvents the alarm, so you can sleep better.


Sense sits on your bedside table and combines the insight of your sleep patterns with the data of the environment in your bedroom, including noise, light, temperature, humidity and particles in the air. When you know what helps or hinders your sleep, you can fix it.
